    Unfortunately, Jenkins does not allow you in a easy way to get the list of Domains and Domains controllers
    from the configuration, so since version 2.0 you need to manually enter the domain you would like to test.

    <p>
    If you would like to use multiple domains, you cannot separate them by comma, you must test them in two different tests.
