<div>
  Active Directory plugin allows you to use a multiple domains configuration.

  Normally, Jenkins will discover the Active Directory domain controllers via DNS, and connect them in the
  order of priority specified in DNS. You can override this behavior by explicitly specifying the host names
  of the domain controllers (and optionally the LDAP port, by appending ":NNN".)

  <p>
  Multiple domain controllers can be specified by using ',' as a separator.

  <p>
  This is useful when the advertised list of domain controller priority is messed up.
