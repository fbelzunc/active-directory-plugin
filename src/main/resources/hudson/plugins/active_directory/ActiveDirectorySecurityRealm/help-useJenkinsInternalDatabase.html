    This option allows to use the Active Directory plugin at the same time the Jenkins internal database
    is available

    <p>
        Useful when the AD server is not reachable for any reason and you cannot log-in. This option allows you
    to not disable security on disk and being able to log-in even if the AD server has any spcific problem.

    <p>
        Also, interesting in case if you want to use an internal user for REST API operations instead of an AD
    user, so the login operations are done much more faster - as they don't not rely on network connectivity.

    <p>
        With this option enabled the plugin will firstly look for the user on the Jenkins internal database, and in case
     it does not find this user - or the password is wrong, it will then look for the user on the AD server.
